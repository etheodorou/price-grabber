1. Remove format from everything so I can format in excel. So no 'â‚¬' or '%' signs so that i can manipulate the format as i want, it might also help with the fuzzy . 

2. Can we code it so that a new column is added next to the product url with the hyperlinks of the product url renamed to something small to not take up space. 

3. Please provide the full code with this implemented, no placeholders please i want full code. 

4. I will open the file 'From Text/CSV' which opened the data correctly. 

5. The picture url is correct now but please also make a new column with a shortened hyperlinks of these urls.
